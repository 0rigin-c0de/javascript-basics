### A dictionary is a data structure that stores data as``` key-value``` pairs. The javaScript object class is designed to operate as dictionary. So, here key value pair is stored in such a way like we store in our phone book which includes the data names and whole numbers. When you look for a phone number you first search for the name  and when you find the name the phone number found right next to the name . So, that is a kind of a dictionary  or we can say that where we can found a particular word is known as dictionary.
